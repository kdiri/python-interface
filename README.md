# python-interface

This repository has been created after reading the blog [Implementing an Interface in Python](https://realpython.com/python-interface/). It contains code examples given in the blog in question. 
I also consulted the blog [python-metaclasses](https://realpython.com/python-metaclasses) to get some additional information.
